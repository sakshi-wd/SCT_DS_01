#📊 Task 01: Bar Chart Visualization – Population by Age Group

🔍 Objective:
Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable, such as India's population by age groups (2022 data reference).

📜 Description:
This project visualizes India's population distribution using a bar chart, grouped by age ranges. The chart highlights the proportion of population segments such as:
      0-14 years
      15-24 years
      25-54 years
      55-64 years
      65+ years
📂 Files Included:
     -age_distribution.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that reads the dataset and generates the bar chart using Matplotlib.
     -age_distribution_dataset.csv: Contains sample age group data.
     -age_distribution_chart.png: Output bar chart image saved by the notebook.

📈 Libraries Used:
    -python
    -Copy code
    -import pandas as pd
    -import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
✅ Conclusion
In this task, we successfully visualized India's population distribution by agegroups using a bar chart. 
The plot clearly shows that the majority of the population falls within the 25–54 years age group, 
indicating a relatively young and working-age population. 
This kind of demographic insight is valuable for planning in areas like healthcare, education, employment, and policymaking. 
Data visualization techniques like bar charts help simplify complex data and make it more understandable for analysis and decision-making.
